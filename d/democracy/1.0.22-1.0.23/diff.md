+   ### Ultimate Chat Application  
+  
+   ![UCA](./images/2.png)  
    Windows version of Ultimate Chat Application.  
    There is so much potential with this program.  
    This is a non-AI chatbot. It's not based on generative AI or AI of any  
    sort.  
    It is self-explanatory, it tries to give a better answer.  
    Still a work in progress.  
    Source code is in PP.rb  
    Generates a hyper optimized C program that is able to respond to  
    prompts locally as fast as theoretically possible using switch  
    statements  
-     __________________________________________________________________  
+   ### Discourse Generator  
+  
+   The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript  
+   library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool  
+   and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes  
+   or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would  
+   be wonderful. Think of how poor quality responses to communications can  
+   be. If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on  
+   web pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and  
+   value oriented responses (or original communications), then there is  
+   literally nothing that couldn't solve. This might be the most useful  
+   library ever created. There could be a tool that would help with  
+   democracy. Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually  
+   resulting in liberty. This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if  
+   50% of all websites used this library. This would help people to be  
+   goal or value oriented, and not be coming up with terrible  
+   communications that, for example, insult people's mothers or education.

    First, you need to click on the bottom part of it. It copies that code

    ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù (the same can be done by doing Control + F12). Make sure you  
    are on Indeed.  
-   Search for something on Indeed, like ‚Äúlabourer‚Äù.  
+   Search for something on Indeed, like ‚Äúlabourer.‚Äù  
    For each result, a new resume and cover letter will be downloaded, each  
    of which is geared for that specific job positing, with the company  
    name and copy role in both of them  
    This way, you can show employers that you really care!  
    The script will open up later pages on Indeed as well.  
    You can generate hundreds of resumes and cover letters as well  
    HTML documents will be downloaded.  
    You have to convert them to PDF, which chrome can do by doing  
    --print-to-pdf

    Then you have to click on the second part, and run that in your command  
    prompt or terminal (Windows or macOS or Linux)  
    All of the generated resumes are numbered, starting from what you  
    enter, which is probably 0

+   [regular expression 1] [regular expression 2] => result  
    Example

    This is a nice tool to find housing with! Everyone needs housing. This  
    can help with that.  
    It is a nice, simple command line tool. You enter the minimum and  
    maximum prices, and Kijiji opens with your options.  
    Along with the resume program, these tools can be __VERY PRACTICAL__

    ### Close  
-   ‚ÄúClose‚Äù is a simple program that closes ‚ÄúEmerald Browser‚Äù, a new web  
-   browser based on the same engine as Chrome. Currently, Emerald Browser  
-   only works on Linux and Mac (Or Windows with Windows Subsystem for  
-   Linux or a Virtual Machine, but getting it to work might be tricky).  
-   ‚Äúclose‚Äù closes the Web Browser, which is normally full-screen.  
-   More accurately, it kills the browser, and all other copies of Emerald  
-   Browser.  
-   Since they are normally full screen, presumably the user would only  
-   have one instance of the browser open.  
-   The browser can have multiple panes (kind of like tabs) open, depending  
-   on how the browser is compiled.  
-   The browser can also be transparent, depending on how it is compiled.  
-   ‚ÄúClose‚Äù is supposed to be used in tandem with ‚Äúopen‚Äù, which is a  
-   command line tool to open the browser.  
-   open  ---->  gets searched in google, and then opened  
-   When you are done, you can do  
-   close  
-   Which closes the browser. It is a simple command.  
-   Currently, Emerald Browser is incomplete. A program exists in this  
-   software project that allows you to open up multiple browser tabs (one  
-   or more tabs) simply by speaking.  
-   Voice recognition would google the multiple sites that you say in your  
-   query (separated by ‚Äúand‚Äù)  
-   ‚Äúfacebook and youtube and google‚Äù  
-   It's hard to get more direct than that!  
-   Emerald browser has a built in the top. The terminal is the navigation  
-   bar.  
-   Some more work needs to be put into the browser.  
-   Currently, new tabs can't be opened, which might be a dealbreaker for  
-   some people.  
-   Currently, content, like YouTube videos, can't be made fullscreen.

    ### Open  
+  
    ‚Äúopen‚Äù is a very efficient program that searches a query from google,  
    and then opens it in Emerald Browser.  
    If you ever want something to ‚Äújust open‚Äù, you can use it.  
    Example  
    open ‚Äúcats‚Äù  
    An earlier version of open worked like this  
-   open    N  
+   open [site1] [site2] [site3] N  
    site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were  
    all shown in different panes  
    An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.  
    The current version can open one or more sites.  
    Example  
    open ‚Äúcats‚Äù ‚Äúdogs‚Äù ‚Äúfrogs‚Äù  
    All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.  
    Just make sure it is compiled in multipane mode if you want to open  
    multiple new sites at the same time.

-     __________________________________________________________________  
   
+   Nth gets the nth line from the input  
    ### Abs  
+  
    Abs gets the absolute value of an integer  
    The absolute value of a number is the value of that number without its  
    sign  
    echo -300 | abs  
    => 300  
    echo 200 | abs  
    => 200  
    (echo -2; echo -10) | sub | abs  
    => 12  
    The last one would do -2 - -10, the result would be -12, and then the  
    absolute value would be computed, and so the result would be 12.

+   ### Ultimate Chat Application  
+  
+   ![UCA](./images/2.png)  
    Windows version of Ultimate Chat Application.  
    There is so much potential with this program.  
    This is a non-AI chatbot. It's not based on generative AI or AI of any  
    sort.  
    It is self-explanatory, it tries to give a better answer.  
    Still a work in progress.  
    Source code is in PP.rb  
    Generates a hyper optimized C program that is able to respond to  
    prompts locally as fast as theoretically possible using switch  
    statements  
-     __________________________________________________________________  
+   ### Discourse Generator  
+  
+   The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript  
+   library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool  
+   and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes  
+   or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would  
+   be wonderful. Think of how poor quality responses to communications can  
+   be. If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on  
+   web pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and  
+   value oriented responses (or original communications), then there is  
+   literally nothing that couldn't solve. This might be the most useful  
+   library ever created. There could be a tool that would help with  
+   democracy. Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually  
+   resulting in liberty. This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if  
+   50% of all websites used this library. This would help people to be  
+   goal or value oriented, and not be coming up with terrible  
+   communications that, for example, insult people's mothers or education.

    preprocessed program becomes a normal C program  
    The compile and run time for a program (if you use tcc and not gcc) can  
    be about 24 milliseconds, which is faster than Ruby to run.

+   About the Name  
    Years ago, I really, really liked Compiz  
    Compiz then forked into Beryl. There was the Emerald Window Manager,  
    which was really nice and beautiful.  
    I actually made another programming language. I made 2 other  
    programming language. One was a full compiler and assembler, that ran  
    code in memory. It was around 16 thousand lines of code. I made a  
    programming language that had the syntax of Python or Ruby, but  
    transpiled into C++. I called that C += 2. I used that other language,  
-   and I created a Web Browser in it based on Chrome. I called it "Emerald  
-   Browser." Emeralds are beautiful green gems.

    line from the front, and argument 2 lines from the back  
    Example

    ### Open  
+  
    ‚Äúopen‚Äù is a very efficient program that searches a query from google,  
    and then opens it in Emerald Browser.  
    If you ever want something to ‚Äújust open‚Äù, you can use it.  
    Example  
    open ‚Äúcats‚Äù  
    An earlier version of open worked like this  
-   open    N  
+   open [site1] [site2] [site3] N  
    site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were  
    all shown in different panes  
    An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.  
    The current version can open one or more sites.  
    Example  
    open ‚Äúcats‚Äù ‚Äúdogs‚Äù ‚Äúfrogs‚Äù  
    All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.  
    Just make sure it is compiled in multipane mode if you want to open  
    multiple new sites at the same time.

    ### Abs  
+  
    Abs gets the absolute value of an integer  
    The absolute value of a number is the value of that number without its  
    sign  
    echo -300 | abs  
    => 300  
    echo 200 | abs  
    => 200  
    (echo -2; echo -10) | sub | abs  
    => 12  
    The last one would do -2 - -10, the result would be -12, and then the  
    absolute value would be computed, and so the result would be 12.

+   ### Ultimate Chat Application  
+  
+   ![UCA](./images/2.png)  
    Windows version of Ultimate Chat Application.  
    There is so much potential with this program.  
    This is a non-AI chatbot. It's not based on generative AI or AI of any  
    sort.  
    It is self-explanatory, it tries to give a better answer.  
    Still a work in progress.  
    Source code is in PP.rb  
    Generates a hyper optimized C program that is able to respond to  
    prompts locally as fast as theoretically possible using switch  
    statements

+   ### Discourse Generator  
+  
+   The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript  
+   library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool  
+   and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes  
+   or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would  
+   be wonderful. Think of how poor quality responses to communications can  
+   be. If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on  
+   web pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and  
+   value oriented responses (or original communications), then there is  
+   literally nothing that couldn't solve. This might be the most useful  
+   library ever created. There could be a tool that would help with  
+   democracy. Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually  
+   resulting in liberty. This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if  
+   50% of all websites used this library. This would help people to be  
+   goal or value oriented, and not be coming up with terrible  
+   communications that, for example, insult people's mothers or education.

    ### Communicate  
+  
    Communicate is cool.  
    Communicate runs a Ruby expression after speaking a prompt (the first  
    argument) and getting your verbal answer (using something unfortunately  
    called ‚Äúnerd-dictation‚Äù, which is a wrapper around another program  
    which deals with speech recognition)  
    Communicate allows you to have conversations with your computer, and it  
    is cross platform  
    (Or it hopefully is)  
    communicate 'What is the best color?' 'case text; when /blue/; puts  
    ‚ÄúYou are right!‚Äù; when /red/; puts ‚ÄúRed is a bad color‚Äù; end '  
    That would be an example of how one could use ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù  
    Make sure you have nerd-dictation on your computer  
    The name nerd-dictation is absolutely awful, and I have to criticize  
    him for not making it have a better name, but it works.

    An earlier version of open worked like this

+   open [site1] [site2] [site3] N  
    site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were  
    all shown in different panes  
    An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.  
    The current version can open one or more sites.  
    Example  
    open ‚Äúcats‚Äù ‚Äúdogs‚Äù ‚Äúfrogs‚Äù  
    All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.

    ### Div  
+  
    Div divides integers  
    Example  
    (echo 5000; echo 100)|div  
    => 50

    ### Mul  
+  
    Multiply numbers  
    echo 1 > file  
    echo 2 > file  
    echo 3 > file  
    echo 4 > file  
    echo 5 > file  
    cat file | mul  
    => 120

+   Nth gets the nth line from the input  
    ### Abs  
+  
    Abs gets the absolute value of an integer  
    The absolute value of a number is the value of that number without its  
    sign  
    echo -300 | abs  
    => 300  
    echo 200 | abs  
    => 200  
    (echo -2; echo -10) | sub | abs  
    => 12  
    The last one would do -2 - -10, the result would be -12, and then the  
    absolute value would be computed, and so the result would be 12.

    ### Add  
+  
    See the sub example  
    add adds integers from the standard input  
    (echo 1; echo 2; echo 3) | add  
    The result would be 6

    ### Sub  
+  
    Sub is a simple command line program that subtracts integers.  
    For some reason, no simple program did this.  
    Which is weird

    ‚Äúis a good word.‚Äù  
    There are other programs in this software project like ‚Äút‚Äù.
