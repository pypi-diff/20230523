-This plugin is brand new! Poetry just added their plugin system recently. Efforts will be made to avoid changes in behavior, but it'll be valuable to gather feedback on this plugin in its early stages before releasing a stable version. However, the test suite is thorough and common cases should be well covered.
+This plugin is tested against multiple versions of Poetry and has an integration focused test suite. It is safe to use this in production, though it is recommend to pin versions. Breaking changes will be avoided unless infeasible due to upstream changes in Poetry.
 
 > Will this plugin drop the upper bound on Python itself?
 
 Believe it or not, this is an even more contentious subset of this issue as Poetry will not allow packages with no upper bound on Python to exist alongside those that include one. This basically means that we cannot relax this requirement without breaking the vast majority of use-cases. For this reason, we cannot relax `python^3` at this time. See [the post on the Poetry discussion board](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/discussions/3757#discussioncomment-435345) for more details.
